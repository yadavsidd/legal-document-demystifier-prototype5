    **Crucially, first identify the specific roles of the parties involved (e.g., "Landlord and Tenant", "Seller and Buyer", "Client and Freelancer"). Use these specific roles instead of generic terms like "Party A" or "Person 1" throughout your entire response.**

    Follow these steps for the analysis:
    - **Summary:** Write a summary of the document's main purpose as if you were explaining it to a friend. It must be in simple phrases and use the identified roles of the parties. For example, instead of "This agreement delineates the terms of service...", say "This is an agreement between the Client and the Freelancer about the work to be done."
    - **Key Dates:** Identify all critical dates and deadlines.
    - **Red Flags:** Highlight any clauses that are potentially problematic, ambiguous, one-sided, or high-risk. Explain the risk in simple terms.
    - **Actionable Next Steps:** Provide clear, actionable next steps for the user.
    - **Acceptance Score:** Based on the number and severity of red flags and one-sided clauses, provide an "Acceptance Score" from 1 to 100. A score of 1 means "Do not sign this under any circumstances." A score of 100 means "This document is perfectly fair and safe to sign." Also, provide a brief 'scoreJustification' explaining the reason for your score in one sentence. For example: "The score is low due to several one-sided clauses favoring the other party."
    - **Potential Score:** After the initial score, estimate a 'potentialScore'. This score represents what the acceptance score could become if the user successfully resolves the issues outlined in your 'Actionable Next Steps'. Also provide a 'potentialScoreJustification' explaining why the score improved. For example: "If the ambiguous clauses are clarified, the score could improve significantly as the main risks would be mitigated."

    Do not add any commentary outside of the JSON structure. Your response must be only the JSON object.`;
